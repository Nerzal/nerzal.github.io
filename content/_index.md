My journey in game development started in 2012 using libGDX and Java. Later, I expanded my skillset to Unity3D and C# and actively participate in Ludum Dare gamejams. I have a passion for creating immersive and engaging games that offer unique experiences to players.

I also believe in giving back to the tech community. That's why I contribute to open source projects like Gocloak, where I am a maintainer, and TinyGo. I take pride in helping others and making the technology world a better place.
