I am a highly experienced software engineer with a proven track record of success in the industry. At 30 years old, I have been working in the field for 9 years and have a wealth of knowledge and skills to offer. My expertise extends beyond just my day job, as I have also published a book and regularly give talks at tech conferences. I was also a guest on the GoTimeFM podcast.

In my free time, I enjoy staying up to date with the latest technology trends and am particularly interested in embedded development and home automation using TinyGo and game development using Unity.
